# simple-dwd-map-with-layers
Very simple page to display all layers available through DWD.
DWD offers a wide range of datasets for Germany. This does not feature data for any other countries.

Why?
Want to display a weather map in your LAN? Have HomeAssistant and want a tile with rock density for your area? No need to search for a service that has no cookie consent or doesnt allows embedding - just put this one file on a webserver. Done.

Status!
This is really just a very quick solution for a project I was working on.
